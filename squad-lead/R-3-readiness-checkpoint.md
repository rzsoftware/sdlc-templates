Hi [PO NAME],

R-3 checkpoint. Here's what moved since R-4 and what's still outstanding.

## Numbers (from Jira)

_Pull from your [Squad Dashboard](https://rzsoftware.github.io/sdlc/metrics/#dashboard-squad). Compare Pipeline Depth to your R-4 snapshot._

| | Value |
|---|---|
| **Engineering Ready stories** | ___ pts |
| **Pipeline coverage** | ___% |
| **Change from R-4** | +/- ___ pts |
| **PTO declarations received** | ___/___ squad members |
| **Sprint candidates pointed** | ___/___ |

<!-- DELETE IF PTO IS 100%: -->
**Action needed:** [NAMES] have not declared PTO for next sprint. Following up directly. Please confirm by R-2.

## Stories Still Not Ready

_This is the narrative Jira can't provide. For each story that hasn't passed DoR, explain the specific gap and whether it's moving or stalled. This is what the PO needs to act on._

| Jira Key | Status | Est Points | Specific DoR Gap | Moving or Stalled? |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
