# VPoE Rolling Dashboard

> **What this is:** A living document that tracks squad health across sprints. Most data now lives in the [VPoE Jira Dashboard](https://rzsoftware.github.io/sdlc/metrics/#dashboard-vpoe) — velocity charts, carry-over, scope adds, and overrides are all there automatically. This document captures what Jira can't: status judgments, coaching notes, patterns, and the trend narrative.
>
> **How to use it:** Update at every sprint close. Pull numbers from Jira Sprint Report and the VPoE Dashboard. Add your coaching notes and pattern observations. This is the document you bring to Monthly Metrics Reviews and Quarterly Squad Health sessions.
> **Fed by:** [Sprint Tracker](sprint-tracker.md) (per-sprint data) | [Starved Sprint Log](starved-sprint-log.md) | [Quarterly Override Review](quarterly-override-review.md) | [VPoE Jira Dashboard](https://rzsoftware.github.io/sdlc/metrics/#dashboard-vpoe)

## Squad Health Over Time

_For each squad: record the sprint status and coaching observations. Quantitative data (commitment ratio, carry-over %) is in Jira's Velocity Chart and Sprint Report — reference it here but don't duplicate it manually. Focus on the judgment and trend interpretation that Jira can't provide._
