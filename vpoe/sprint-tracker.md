# VPoE Sprint Tracker

> **What this is:** One document per sprint. Open it at R-4, check things off as they arrive, and by R-1 you know exactly where every squad stands. If a box is unchecked at the milestone deadline, that's your signal to follow up.
>
> **How to use it:** Copy this template into Confluence or a shared doc at the start of every sprint cycle. Bookmark it. Check it daily during refinement week (R-4 through R-1). It takes 2 minutes.
