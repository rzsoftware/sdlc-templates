# VPoE Sprint Tracker

> **What this is:** One document per sprint. Open it at R-4, check things off as they arrive, and by R-1 you know exactly where every squad stands. If a box is unchecked at the milestone deadline, that's your signal to follow up.
>
> **How to use it:** Copy this template at the start of every sprint cycle. Check it daily during refinement week (R-4 through R-1). It takes 2 minutes. Numbers come from the [VPoE Dashboard](https://rzsoftware.github.io/sdlc/metrics/#dashboard-vpoe) — this document tracks process compliance and narrative, not data Jira already has.
> **Fed by:** Squad Lead [R-4](../squad-lead/R-4-pipeline-status.md), [R-3](../squad-lead/R-3-readiness-checkpoint.md), [R-2](../squad-lead/R-2-pipeline-warning.md), [R-1](../squad-lead/R-1-final-status.md), [Scorecard Entry](../squad-lead/starved-sprint-scorecard-entry.md)
> **Feeds into:** [Cross-Squad Summary](R-1-cross-squad-summary.md) | [Rolling Dashboard](rolling-dashboard.md) | [Starved Sprint Log](starved-sprint-log.md)
