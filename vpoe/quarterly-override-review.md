| **Squads affected** | ___ |
| **Override requestors** | ___ |
| **Total original estimate** | ___ pts |
| **Total actual points spent** | ___ pts |
| **Average inflation** | ___x |

| **Scope change rate** | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| **Carry-over rate** | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| **Rework rate** | ___% | ___% | ___% |

**Estimated waste from overrides this quarter:** ___ story points of rework that would not have occurred if stories met DoR before entering sprint.

## Requestor Distribution

| Requestor | Title | # of Overrides | Outcomes |
|-----------|-------|---------------|----------|
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___x inflation, ___% carried over |
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___x inflation, ___% carried over |

## Trend

| Quarter | Overrides | Avg Inflation | Carry-Over Rate | Rework Rate |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Q[N-2] | ___ | ___x | ___% | ___% |
| Q[N-1] | ___ | ___x | ___% | ___% |
| Q[N] | ___ | ___x | ___% | ___% |

## Interpretation

<!-- DELETE ALL BUT ONE, or write your own: -->

**Overrides are rare and outcomes are acceptable.** The override process is working as intended — used only for genuine emergencies, with manageable cost.

---

**Overrides are increasing and costing more than waiting.** This quarter's overrides averaged ___x their original estimate and ___% carried over. Waiting for full definition would have saved approximately ___ story points of rework. Recommendation: ___

---

**Overrides are being used to systematically bypass DoR.** ___% of sprint stories this quarter were overrides. The Definition of Ready gate is effectively non-functional. Either the pipeline needs to be fixed or the organization needs to formally lower its quality standard — but we should stop pretending we have a gate we're not enforcing.

## Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Rationale |

| 1 | ___ | ___ |

| 3 | ___ | ___ |
